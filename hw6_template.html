<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Trevor VanAuken</h2>
<h3>This map shows the owner costs, in dollars, per Ohio county. Unfortunately, the data set only had around half of the counties,
    but it did have Summit County, which is where I used to live. Many counties near the East edge of the state have low owner costs. 
    Summit county had relatively lower owener costs compared to the state, which is interesting because I remember it being fairly
    expensive when I lived there.
